    The June 2019 Advancing Foundation Archives conference was planned and
    co-hosted by records and archives professionals from the Rockefeller Archive
    Center, the Ford Foundation, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and the Hogg
    Foundation for Mental Health.

  <p>
    This core group of original AFA partner institutions has expanded to include
    colleagues from the IUPUI University Libraryâ€™s Ruth Lilly Special Collections,
    the Gates Archive, and the Gates Foundation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Together, the AFA Partners are planning the next Advancing Foundation
    Archives conference, tentatively scheduled for Fall 2023, and will be
    developing a more robust online collaboration platform for the AFA community.

    The current AFA website was developed and is maintained by the Rockefeller
    Archive Center.
