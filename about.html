  <p>Some of us work at archival repositories, others are records management or archives
  consultants, still more are on staff at foundations and nonprofits.</p>

  <p>At the 2019 Advancing Foundation Archives (AFA) meeting, we gathered for the first
  time in almost thirty years to talk about the challenges we all faced. That conversation
  was only the beginning. We built this online community to be an ongoing space for
  conversation and collaboration.</p>

  <p>The AFA community is supported by the Rockefeller Archive Center working alongside
  many other foundations and nonprofits focused on documenting the legacy of philanthropy
  in our world. Weâ€™re glad you found us.</p>
