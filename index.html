        Building A Community for Knowledge Sharing and Problem Solving

      <p class="card__text">
        The June 2019 conference Advancing Foundation Archives: Advocacy,
        Strategies, and Solutions was attended by over 100 archivists, grants
        managers, foundation leaders, information specialists, historians, legal
        experts, and many others who gathered in New York City to share ideas,
        practices, and resources.
      </p>

      <p class="card__text">
        This website, along with the conference Proceedings publication and the
        links to additional Resources, is the first step in building a broader
        community dedicated to effective foundation information governance, records
        management, archival practice, and knowledge management for the purpose
        of preserving, making accessible, and learning from the history of philanthropy.
