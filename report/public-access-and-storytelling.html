<p class="report__lede">
  The obvious reason researchers might turn to foundation archives is to understand
  the history of philanthropy but that is only the tip of the iceberg. Skim the Rockefeller
  Archive Center's storytelling platform <a href="https://resource.rockarch.org/">Re:source</a>
  and you'll see researchers focused on a wide range of topics – public health, social
  justice, the environment, art and culture, and the list goes on. As James Allen
  Smith said in his 1991 essay in <span class="text--italic">Establishing Foundation
  Archives</span>, "foundations often house material that is exceedingly important
  for understanding the nation's social history, intellectual developments in various
  academic fields, as well as the genesis of many important public policy initiatives."
  John Craig expanded on this point in his 2012 white paper: "In the hands of good
  researchers, the records of foundations can provide guidance for future generations
  in tackling new and continuing social problems."
</p>

<p>
  In short, what a foundation learned through its grantmaking can have exponential
  impact when a researcher combines it with what other foundations with a similar
  focus learned. Researchers can analyze data and records from multiple sources and
  present what they found in a way that educates the public and informs future decision
  making. Making the leap from an internal archive to sharing records with the public
  may seem daunting, but there are experts available to help.
</p>

<h2 id="archival-repositories">Archival Repositories</h2>

<p>
  Archival records are managed by many different types of institutions. Colleges
  and universities often collect archival material in a special collections library
  that houses manuscripts, papers of individuals, and records of organizations.
  The Ruth Lilly Special Collections &amp; Archives at Indiana University Purdue
  University Indianapolis (IUPUI) has a particular focus on records that document
  the history of the philanthropic tradition, and their collections support student
  researchers at IUPUI's Lilly Family School of Philanthropy. Angela White, Philanthropic
  Studies archivist at IUPUI, described her interactions with both donors and researchers:
</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    I spend a lot of time with potential collection donors, with current collection
    donors, helping them to understand why they might want to preserve their history
    and what use they can get out of it once they have decided to preserve that history.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have three main categories of external researchers. People who are interested
    in a particular foundation; some of that is internal around anniversaries, but
    there are a lot of people who come through the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy
    who are interested in doing a deep dive into a particular one. There are researchers
    who are interested in mainly grantees, so the actual foundation interest is sort
    of adjacent. And then we have researchers who are interested in data sets of multiple
    foundations.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  A foundation may want to select a college or university library that collects
  records on a topic that reflects the foundation's grantmaking focus or in the
  same city or state. The latter may be an especially appropriate choice for a community
  foundation that makes gifts to local organizations. By choosing a local college
  or university library, the records of both the foundation and its grantees remain
  in the community. If the foundation was created by an individual with close ties
  to his or her alma mater, that college or university library may be designated
  as the repository of the foundation's records. The Atlantic Philanthropies were
  donated to Cornell University Special Collections in part because its founder,
  Chuck Feeney, was an alumnus.
</p>

<p>
  Other institutions that collect and preserve archival collections include public
  libraries, historical societies, and cultural institutions. The Rockefeller Archive
  Center (RAC), one of the meeting's organizers, is unique in that it is an independent
  operating foundation established to serve as public archival repository for the
  records of philanthropy. Bob Clark, director of archives at RAC, recounted how
  his institution evolved:
</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    We were originally founded in 1974 by the Rockefeller family and several Rockefeller-founded
    organizations: the Rockefeller Foundation, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and Rockefeller
    University. Over the succeeding decades, though, our collections have vastly grown
    in scope to include such representative organizations as the Ford Foundation, the
    Hewlett Foundation, the Luce Foundation, Social Science Research Council, Russell
    Sage, the Commonwealth Fund, and many more. In addition to gathering and preserving
    philanthropic records, we also make them accessible to public research. We host
    around four hundred onsite researchers per year and respond to over two thousand
    email inquiries per year, and we have an innovative research and education team
    led by my colleague and friend, Barb Shubinski, that assists foundations in leveraging
    their history. And we also are using innovative new technologies to make sure the
    stories of philanthropy get out to the broader public.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Talking with other foundations that have a similar grantmaking or geographic focus
  is one way to begin building a list of potential repositories. Consider local colleges
  and universities, regional historical societies, or large public libraries. Once
  you have a list, you will want to have a conversation with each repository about
  whether they will be a good fit for the foundation's records. Some repositories
  may decide that philanthropic records are not within the scope of records they
  typically collect. Though Cornell Libraries doesn't have a specific focus on philanthropic
  records, as mentioned earlier, it is interested in the records of the university's
  alumni. In her presentation, Phoebe Kowalewski, Atlantic Philanthropies archivist,
  described how the foundation's records found a home at Cornell:
</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    In the case of Atlantic Philanthropies, initial discussions began two years prior
    to the first shipment of records to the archives. Cornell's proposal for project-planning
    funding was submitted and approved in 2014. In January 2015, an archives consultant
    was hired by Cornell to survey records, both paper and electronic, at the New York,
    Bermuda, Belfast, and London offices. As a result, she drafted an in-depth processing
    plan, and so by September 2015, Cornell was awarded the grant to house, process,
    and promote Atlantic's archives. In 2016, a deed of gift was drawn up and signed
    by Atlantic and Cornell staff. In addition to providing the transfer of title,
    the deed of gift also outlined the physical transfer of the collection as well
    as listed types of records to be excluded, included, or restricted. It is important
    to remember that even though an archive receives your materials, it does not mean
    it will make those materials immediately available to researchers. The deed of
    gift also established the Archives Advisory Committee in order to continue the
    dialogue between Cornell and Atlantic, and we meet up with them twice a month,
    now we're down to once a month, and we have in-person meetings once a year, so
    close, close communication.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  The agreement Kowalewski mentioned above is a donor agreement, which transfers
  title and other rights to the archival repositors. Some foundations prefer to
  sign a deposit agreement, which transfers physical or digital records into the
  care of the repository but does not transfer title. Either type of agreement can
  incorporate embargo periods that restrict access to certain record groups for a
  specific period of time. As Kowalewski also noted, it costs money to process and
  describe, permanently store and preserve, and provide public access to the foundation's
  records. Many foundations support the archival institution with a one-time grant
  or series of grants that cover the costs of archival services and long-term storage.
</p>

<p>
  There are several reasons a foundation may choose to place their archival records
  in the care of an archival repository. Mediating public access to those records
  once any restrictions have expired may be primary. Libraries like Cornell and IUPUI
  and repositories like the Rockefeller Archive Center not only field enquiries and
  facilitate research by helping researchers find primary sources to support their
  work, but they also promote the collections in their archives to the public so
  researchers will know the foundation's records are available for study. These
  institutions have reading rooms where researchers can come to view physical records
  and have professional archivists and reference staff who are knowledgeable about
  all the records in their collections and can help researchers zero in on exactly
  what records they would like to view.
</p>

<p>
  Hilary Pennington related how the demand for information about the Ford Foundation's
  history began to overwhelm staff:
</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    The values of our foundation have always been open, accessible, and available for
    history, as you heard Darren just say. We had a policy, starting in the 1970s,
    to allow the, quote, "freest possible access to and use of Foundation information
    without infringing on the rights of the person who created that information or
    hampering the current work of the Foundation." What we found was that we couldn't
    manage the degree of interest. There were so many researchers coming from outside
    the foundation that there came to be about a one-year waiting list for them just
    to have access to what they wanted, and we weren't adequately staffed to fulfill
    that. So, in 2011, we made the decision to move our archives to RAC, which is a
    great decision. I think that that has been very, very good for external researchers
    and it's part of this family of collections that I think, from a research point
    of view, will probably make it so much easier to look at what we do, together with
    the work the Rockefeller Foundation or RBF [Rockefeller Brothers Fund] does.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Another key reason to place records in the care of a professionally managed and
  staffed repository relates to storage. Most repositories store record collections
  in secure vaults with climate control systems that are optimized based on the
  format of the records. For example, film and photographic negatives require different
  storage conditions than paper records. Records are monitored for preservation
  issues and any damage is remediated or repaired to ensure the long-term use of
  the records. Repositories also preserve digital records according to best practices,
  which goes far beyond folders in a shared drive or in cloud storage. (See Section
  4 for more on digital preservation.)
</p>

<h2 id="digital-access-to-public-archives">Digital Access to Public Archives</h2>

<p>
  It hasn't always been easy for researchers to find foundation records, but that
  has changed thanks to technology. Now most collecting institutions describe their
  collection on websites and feature them in blogs or online exhibits. Aggregated
  library catalogs include entries for archival collections alongside books and journals,
  making them easier for students doing research to discover. Often an Internet search
  can return results for archival collections that are publicly accessible on the
  web. As Bob Clark noted:
</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    Web access is creating opportunities for broader access, so it's not just whether
    you can afford to come to the Archive Center or to Indiana to research, that in
    and of itself is limiting your ability to do research. Even if you're sitting on
    your couch in Beijing you can have the same research experience as if you were
    coming to [the Rockefeller Archive Center in] Westchester County or to [the Lilly
    Library at IUPUI in] Indiana.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  These online finding aids allow researchers to narrow their search based on how
  the records are described. Researchers can request that a physical document be
  digitized, and a copy sent electronically. For certain records, such as photographs
  or documents that are in the public domain, users may be able to download copies
  directly from the repository website.
</p>

<p>
  As with any technology, understanding how to use it has a learning curve. Eric Abrahamson,
  historian with Vantage Point History, voiced his concerns:
</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    One of the things that we're finding as archives move into the digital sphere is
    the challenge of building the kind of narrative that Hilary Pennington talked about.
    All your collecting really, the whole point of most of it, is to be able to generate
    narrative and storytelling. One of the things we're discovering is that in the
    digital world there is obviously an ocean of information compared to what existed
    in the past. It's very granular. It's much less synthesized than it was in the
    past. I'm not sure historians are being trained to make the transition. I think
    lawyers are being trained how to work with this information, but I don't think
    historians are being trained about how to work with digital archives.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  In response, Bob Clark described the approach the Rockefeller Archive Center is
  taking:
</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    What we try to do, as we're organizing digital records, is kind of bring you back
    to that aggregate level with descriptive work that can enhance your research process,
    so that as a researcher, you can get to know the records and know the terminologies
    well enough to help guide your research through these granular records.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Organizations focused on enhancing knowledge in the social sector are also collecting
  and organizing archival records across multiple organizations and making them available
  in one place. <a href="https://www.issuelab.org/">IssueLab</a> by Candid, is one
  of these. This aggregated collection of foundation reports, impact studies, and
  datasets can be searched on several facets such as program area, geographic location,
  publication date, document type, and more. Lisa Brooks, IssueLab's co-founder,
  described the repository in more detail:
</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    An institutional repository is a searchable collection of digital objects, so you
    can think of anything from an image file to a video or an audio file, on out to
    the kinds of publications that you probably funded – research studies, evaluations,
    this kind of thing. Users can access details about these objects, so there's some
    metadata describing the object, making sure that they understand what it is they're
    about to grab. Users can access the complete objects, and the collection is accessible
    to anyone at any time.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  When a foundation sends a report to IssueLab for public access, IssueLab distributes
  those documents beyond its own website to a network that includes WorldCat, the
  world's largest library catalog. This wider distribution network means more historians
  and researchers will be able to find publicly available foundation reports, extending
  the impact of grant-funded research even further.
</p>

<p>
  A well-managed archive can be a tremendous asset when it comes time to tell the
  foundation's story. Some foundations publish books or host exhibits in public spaces.
  Others mount virtual exhibits, publications, and special websites. The
  <a href="https://centennial.commonwealthfund.org/">Commonwealth Fund's Centennial
  website</a>, for example, relies on the foundation's professionally managed archive
  to share the foundation's history online. Internal staff at the Fund turned to
  their archives, which had been donated to the Rockefeller Archive Center, and
  with the assistance of the RAC's Research and Education team, it uncovered the
  facts, photos, and other historical information that made this engaging website
  possible.
</p>

<p>
  The Rockefeller Brothers Fund also built out a
  <a href="https://www.rbf.org/about/about-us/timeline">web-based timeline</a> that
  illustrates their history. Hope Lyons described how that came about:
</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    We have a platform that's kind of a website off of our website, if you will, that's
    focused exclusively on our history. It's a timeline that we worked with the [Rockefeller]
    Archive Center to develop.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  The Simons Foundation also used its website as a platform to host a unique collection
  of video interviews that captures the lives of scientists in their own words.
  Marion Greenup explained the project this way:
</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    We have an interest in the history of mathematics, for example, and a lot of very
    famous mathematicians are no longer [with us]. So, we've started a process, others
    have done it too, of doing very long, unstructured interviews to try to record
    this history. We then started trying to figure out how to present that in smaller
    bits and bytes and sessions.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  The long, unstructured interviews were edited and divided into video chapters that
  were then published as a virtual exhibit on the Simons Foundation's website as
  <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/series/science-lives/">Science Lives</a>,
  a series of extended interviews with some of the giants of 20th-century mathematics
  and science.
</p>

<p>
  Whatever form the story takes, project managers will need to build relationships
  within the foundation to ensure that leadership is on board with how the story
  will be told, both in terms of the medium to be used and the elements that will
  be included. Presenters during the "Collaborative Case Studies" session reflected
  on how they laid the groundwork for developing the story they wanted to tell, setting
  parameters and expectations. For example, Michael Walter at International House
  described internal conversations about how to share the organization's story
  publicly.
</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    We've also had a lot of conversations about how we can bring the archives out of
    that room and create exhibitions around them. There have been a lot of conversations
    about how we can leverage these archives, and we're very fortunate to be able
    to house them at the House.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Eric Abrahamson of Vantage Point History talked about how important it is to help
  leadership see the benefit of telling a balanced story:
</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    As storytellers and as historians who are often writing history that's sponsored,
    we often hear the concern, "Well, you're just writing what they want you to say."
    We work very hard not to do that, and one of the things that we work hard to do
    is to persuade executives that a complex story is better for their organization
    than a simple story of triumph, that failure is often more instructive than success,
    and that you can tell very difficult stories if you treat everybody with respect,
    allow different perspectives, and don't throw people under the bus. Most of the
    time you can tell a story that honors people in the process, even though there
    are winners and losers. And we find that most of the time if we work that through
    with the executives, we are able to tell what I think are remarkably candid stories.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Regardless of what shape the narrative takes, the stories foundations have to tell
  about their grantees, their impact, and themselves are an important part of social
  history. Foundations and the work they support have an impact on communities in
  so many ways. Everyone has experienced the power of story. When a foundation shares
  its work through storytelling, it is educating the public in a way that resonates.
</p>
