  The Advancing Foundation Archives conference concluded with two capstone
  speakers: Jack Meyers, president of the Rockefeller Archive Center and Nicki
  Lodico, director of information management for the Ford Foundation.
</p>

<h2 id="closing-remarks-of-jack-meyers">Closing Remarks of Jack Meyers:</h2>

<p>I was reflecting on the difference between the problems we face now and those
  faced by attendees at the conference thirty years ago. At that time, the
  organizers faced a real challenge. Foundations are not organizations that naturally
  think historically, and I think this is partially because of the kind of things
  Darren was talking about this morning, that the very things that give foundations
  their freedom, the lack of paying customers for example, are the things that
  inhibit that. Think about it for a minute. No corporation could stay in business
  if it didn't think historically, if it kept making the same mistakes over and
  over again without learning from them. And no nonprofit could continue to exist
  if it kept making the same mistakes over and over again. Donors would simply
  stop giving money or audiences would stop coming to events. Foundations, on the
  other hand, can make the same mistakes year after year, decade after decade, and
  still be just fine, as long as they have a good investment manager. There is no
  internal imperative to think historically in foundations. This was a major challenge
  for the first people who began to try to talk to foundations about their archives—they
  were telling them that there were things that could, in fact, be learned from
  their past, whether these things were mistakes or successes. And foundations
  weren't exactly sure why this was important for their current work.
</p>

<p>
  The other challenge came from the historians, who had to be convinced that there
  was something valuable in foundation archives. Not a lot of people showed up at
  the [Rockefeller] Archive Center in the first decade or so of its existence. It
  took researchers some time to understand that, in addition to information about
  the foundations themselves, foundation archives contained rich historical material
  about organizations and people from all over the world.
</p>

<p>
  These were the things that the first conference thirty years ago really tried to
  tackle. To make the case to both sides that archives had value to foundations and
  that historians could learn from those archives.
</p>

<p>
  What I found fascinating about today's meeting is that we've taken it as a given
  that these archives are valuable historically. There hasn't been a lot of discussion
  about that, and that's a real sign of progress, I think. So, I want to thank
  everybody for today. Both the organizers and all of you for taking the time out
  of the press of immediate business to come here and spend a whole day thinking
  together about the field's new issues. As Darren said, I hope it's not another
  thirty years until we do this again.
</p>

<p>
  Of course, there are still a lot of challenges out there. Many of the challenges
  come from two words that didn't even appear in the report 30 years ago. I looked
  back and the words "digital records" are nowhere to be found in the proceedings in
  1989. But they present huge new challenges, both for your organizations and for
  those of us who are involved in running an archive for researchers. The issues
  mentioned today about how to give context to all this stuff that institutions are
  producing, and whether that context comes from new kinds of finding aids, or oral
  histories or linkages to other kinds of information will be a major challenge for
  all of us to unwind in the coming years.
</p>

<p>
  There aren't simple answers to any of this. If there were, we could have sent you
  all an informational booklet, and we wouldn't have had this conference. The issues
  re something that as a community we really need to discuss together in order to
  move toward solutions—probably not a single solution but many solutions that will,
  themselves, inevitably evolve over time. But that's the value of ongoing discussions.

<h2 id="closing-remarks-of-nicki-lodico">Closing Remarks of Nicki Lodico:</h2>

<p>
  I just have a few things to add, and one is that I have had the great good fortune
  of working with Jack and his team since 2011. Wow, it's been quite a journey and
  it has been an amazing learning experience and an amazing partnership. I can't say
  that I've ever had a better partnership with another colleague organization. It's
  really been fantastic. Many of you in this room know that the Ford Foundation has
  been very happy to share what we've learned the hard way, and I invite you all to
  continue to be in contact because that's something that we're very willing to do
  and feel that we're obligated to do for the sector, and we take that very seriously.
</p>

<p>
  I just want to share a few soundbites from today. First, "You want to keep records
  that tell your story but doing this isn't without risk." "Unfortunately, risk is
  an ever-changing landscape." That one terrifies me slightly. "Be flexible." We
  heard that, I think, in just about everyone's presentation. "Email has caused major
  disruptions in how we record our work." I think we all feel that universally.
  "We need to start paying attention to datasets," which is an emerging key challenge
  for records managers and archivists, and I don't know that anyone has any answers,
  but academia may be able to teach us a bit about what they know. "Oral history
  presents an enormous opportunity to record an organization's history." We're
  learning that now. We're working with Eric and his team. We've recently gone
  through the opening of oral histories that were recorded in the 1970s and wow,
  some of them were really "wow." But worth the wait. And then, "Partnership." Great
  work is happening in the sector, and I think we should continue to support each
  other and to champion this work.
</p>

<p>
  And lastly, I want to say that Darren Walker does not say what he doesn't mean.
  So, I'm going to take him up on his gracious offer this morning of sponsoring a
  continued discussion about archives and records and philanthropy, and I hope to
  see you all at our next meeting.
</p>

<p>
  To build a complete and nuanced picture of the history of philanthropy, the archival
  record must capture the history of foundations large and small and record the work
  of grantees in all sectors of society and across the globe. Publications like
  this one, as well as the recorded presentations available on YouTube, can provide
  support for new and growing foundation archives. But there is more work ahead.
  The ever-changing nature of how, where, and in what form foundations create and
  store records will require continued collaboration among archivists, records managers,
  legal experts, and other legal professionals.
