  Archives, history, narrative. Our society is informed by people like you who document,
  who archive, and preserve our history, and our history tells us who we are as a
  people and as a society. Philanthropy has played a critical role in shaping who
  we were as a people. And so, the work that you do is critical. It's critical to
  our civilization, it's critical to our democracy because this democracy depends
  on knowing who we are and being inspired, finding from those narratives stories
  that help us dream and help us believe, even in dark times, what is possible. When
  Nikki [Lodico, Director of Information Management, Ford Foundation] told me that
  this conference was happening I said, "Thirty years? This conference should happen
  every year! Why aren't we doing this on an ongoing basis? Nikki, we have to do
  this more often." Seriously, we'll help fund it. I mean, it's a really important
  thing. This is hugely important. And I'm really grateful to all of the co-sponsors
  who made this day possible.

  Now, of course, in this digital era there are new challenges that come when we
  think about how we preserve our history. So how do we think about long-term preservation
  of digital records because it is not easy to organize, especially for people like
  me, how to think about recording all of it. I have PDFs of McGeorge Bundy's correspondence,
  of Henry Ford II's notes, of all sorts of things that give me an insight and a
  window into the Ford Foundation's history, and with the help of Nikki and her team
  I've become more aware of what I need to do because the task is not a simple one.
  Because this president does less of the things that McGeorge Bundy used to do, which
  was to take handwritten notes from a program officer about the Civil Rights Program
  and write in the margins, and then have someone else do the same, and all in just
  one document. I don't do that. I get a Word document, or an Excel spreadsheet and
  I make little notes and annotations in the side, but I'm not really sure exactly
  how that's going to be preserved. Fortunately, the team here has helped me to be
  thoughtful that when I am doing the work of the president of the Foundation, I am
  doing it in a digital era. I am thinking about the future and thinking about preserving
  a record so that future presidents can benefit from the things that this president
  does right and wrong and the lessons learned, just as I have. Because the amazing
  thing about this Foundation is the remarkable record that has been left over eight
  decades. We are enormously grateful to our colleagues at the Rockefeller Archive
  Center because you all have made the most efficient and most robust archive available,
  not just to scholars, because scholars are a first line of people interested, but
  there are people beyond scholars, as you know, who are interested in the work.

  We can't take impact seriously if we don't take the preservation of our history
  seriously and we're not willing to invest in it.

<p>
  I think that today, during a time of growing inequality and a time of growing
  cynicism about wealth and even about philanthropy, there is greater demand on
  us to be transparent in ways that we haven't had to be in the past. We remain
  the only sector in our society that does not have an external check on us. Yes,
  we have the IRS, and yes, we have regulations, and our general counsel keeps us
  out of trouble. But I worked at a bank. I worked at a nonprofit. Every day there
  was external pressure on me and the organizations I worked for to deliver for
  customers, clients, people living in Harlem who we were there to serve. Every
  day I felt that pressure. If we're to be honest with ourselves about philanthropy,
  we don't feel that pressure. We feel a different pressure. A passion to do justice
  in the world and to make a difference, and to cure and solve some of these seemingly
  intractable problems. But it really takes a lot of self-generated determination
  to be transparent, to monitor one's institutions and to really take impact seriously.
  We can't take impact seriously if we don't take the preservation of our history
  seriously and we're not willing to invest in it. It starts with the president and
  the board. It is incumbent on every board of a legacy foundation, and even newly
  created foundations and donors, to see the work of people like you, so that they
  can understand the history that they are making and their responsibility to preserve
  that history and to tell their story. So, sharing knowledge, sharing what we are
  learning, thinking about how preservation helps us during this time when we've
  got so much risk assessment going on, how preserving history, our records, our
  documents, can help us mitigate risk.
</p>

<p>
  For me, as I think about the Ford Foundation's history and my own personal interest,
  I love history and I love being at the Ford Foundation because there is so much history,
  and so much of the history is personal. In 1965, I was a little boy in a small
  town in rural Texas sitting on the front porch of our little shotgun house, and
  a lady walked up to the porch, and she said to my mother that she was there to
  talk about a new government program that was going to be starting that summer.
  The program was called Head Start. I was enrolled in Head Start, and I was lucky
  enough to be in the first Head Start class. Lo and behold, when I came to the Ford
  Foundation I said, "I need to know our history. I'd love to know more about our
  history." Somewhere along the line someone said, "Oh, well, Darren was in Head
  Start," and of course what happens? In just a matter of hours, Nikki Lodico presents
  me with binders upon binders on the Ford Foundation's investment in a research
  project at Yale University in the early '60s, which made the recommendation to
  the then new Department of Economic Opportunity to include this program called
  Head Start as a part of the Great Society. I also went to college on Pell grants
  because I was from a low-income family and the Pell grant program was intended
  for students like me. Lo and behold, there in the Ford Foundation archives the
  Ford Foundation played a role in creating the Pell grant program, which wasn't
  called the Pell grant program back then. It became the Pell grant program after
  its efficacy was proven. Senator Claiborne Pell took it up as its great champion
  and made it national policy.
</p>

<p>
  I could go on and on and on about the Ford Foundation's history. What preserving
  that history has made possible for us today is to have credibility and currency.
  And because we invested so meticulously, and some would say rather expensively,
  yes, that is true, but it has been worth every dollar we have invested. Because
  we are able to tell the story of Muhammad Yunus walking into the Ford Foundation's
  office in Bangladesh in the 1970s with a paper, an idea for something called microfinance
  and a vision for something called Grameen Bank, and how if the Ford Foundation
  got behind him, he might be able to help reduce poverty in the world. We have that
  documented. We have the entire narrative of Muhammad Yunus and the Ford Foundation
  and Grameen Bank and what he went on to do. Part of the good news of these last
  few years has been that poverty in the world has actually gone down, and he has
  contributed and the movement for microfinance contributed to that positive outcome.
</p>

<p>
  As you can see, I am very enthusiastic about the work that you do. I hope you feel
  it. I know you're enthusiastic, and I hope your institutions, your presidents,
  your boards, are as enthusiastic as I am and as the Ford trustees are about that
  history because we can't have a future if we don't know our history. We don't know
  our history if we're not investing in the collection of it and the preservation
  of it, and in telling the story of it.
</p>

<p>
  So, Nikki, thank you for allowing me to address this auspicious and marvelous,
  splendid group of colleagues. I'm really grateful that you're all here. And Nikki,
  I'm going to hold you to it. We can't wait thirty more years for another conference.
  Thank you all very much.
