<p class="report__lede">
  This publication represents an abridged, synthesized version of the panels, presentations,
  and table discussions that took place at the Advancing Foundation Archives: Advocacy,
  Strategies, and Solutions conference, held on June 12, 2019, in the Mandela Room
  of the Ford Foundation headquarters in New York City. The conference was co-sponsored
  by the Rockefeller Archive Center, Ford Foundation, Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and Hogg
  Foundation for Mental Health, and it was the first convening in nearly three decades
  to address the importance of managing, preserving, and providing access to foundation
  records and archives.

<p>
  Though more than one hundred people attended, many more stand
  to benefit from a resource that captures key learnings. To present the meeting
  in text form, the editors condensed one hundred pages of transcripts, fleshed out
  concepts where needed, and gathered additional resources for readers who wish to
  delve deeper into a particular topic. Most of the quotations are taken verbatim
  from the conference transcripts, but some have been lightly edited for clarity
  and conciseness.

  As Jack Meyers, president of the Rockefeller Archive Center, said in his closing
  remarks at the meeting, foundation archivists now take it as a given that the records
  they collect have value. Nonetheless, there are other decision makers (and
  readers) to whom a clearer picture of the value of foundation archives might be
  useful. Imagine that a program officer is researching a new grantmaking program
  to support young artists, and a long-time staff member mentions a similar program
  funded in the early 1990s. If that foundation has maintained an archive over the
  years, the program officer will be able to find notes, board documents, approved
  grants, and even evaluations that will clarify how that program was developed, what
  worked, and perhaps most importantly, what didn't. If the foundation does not have
  an archive, the program officer may be able to hunt down some of the relevant documents
  but, more than likely, pertinent records will be in boxes tucked away in offsite
  storage, buried in a network shared drive, or saved in file formats that are no
  longer readable by today's systems. Research scenarios like this may play out across
  the organization, from the CEO who is writing a speech and wants to know what a
  long-ago predecessor was thinking on a particular topic, to a financial analyst
  developing a report on grant payout trends over the life of the foundation. As
  John Craig wrote in 2012, "Archival records enrich the research base for consideration
  of foundations' future directions and help ensure program continuity. The lessons
  from earlier experience that they hold can help prevent strategic and tactical
  mistakes by current and future foundation managers."
</p>

<p>
  A well-managed archive supports staff by providing institutional knowledge that
  helps move the foundation forward. In a similar way, providing public access to
  a foundation's archive can help strengthen ties to the communities it serves.
  Foundations that believe in transparency and make the decision to open their
  archive to the public demonstrate a willingness to be held accountable for their
  impact on society. Even though foundations may restrict records for five, ten, even
  twenty-five years before access is granted, by building an archive they are committing
  to preserving records that contain unique information about the communities, issues,
  people, and organizations they fund through their grantmaking. When those
  records are open, researchers benefit from a rich, well-preserved store of information
  about the history of philanthropy. "In the hands of good researchers, the records
  of foundations can provide guidance for future generations in tackling new and
  continuing social problems" (Craig, 2012). Historians conducting research in foundation
  archives have been able to track the birth of educational broadcast television
  through the records of the Ford Foundation, the ebb and flow of healthcare
  funding in rural communities through the records of the Commonwealth Fund, and
  the international response to the humanitarian crisis in the South Caucasus in
  1915-16 through the records of the Near East Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation.
</p>

<p>
  The information professionals and foundation staff who gathered in New York on
  June 12, 2019, shared the belief that creating, preserving, and providing access
  to foundation records are critical activities, whether they are done to provide
  access only to staff or to external researchers as well.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to a shared belief in the value of foundation archives, attendees
  also shared challenges:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Which documents, digital and physical, should be classified as records, and where should they be stored?</li>
  <li>Which records, digital and physical, have archival value, and how and where should they be preserved?</li>
  <li>What risks are foundations taking by preserving certain types of records, and what are the risks if they don't?</li>
  <li>Whose history is being erased by deleting records that contain evidence of the foundation's work?</li>
  <li>How do foundations responsibly share their archives publicly yet respect the privacy of staff, grantees, and, in some cases, founders?</li>
</ul>

<p>
  These are among the questions that meeting participants discussed throughout the
  day, and those conversations are synthesized in this publication in the following
  sections:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="report__section-title">Perspectives of Foundation Stakeholders</span>
    describes how stakeholders in foundations engage (or do not engage) with their
    archive. This includes board members and foundation executive leaders, but also
    staff across the foundation who often are the most prolific record creators.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="report__section-title">Motivating Issues and Events</span>
    examines some of the scenarios that often give rise to the idea of building
    an archive – a major anniversary, a retiring board chair, a litigation threat –
    how attendees wrestled with those ideas, and where they turned for help.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="report__section-title">Records Management and Archives</span>
    discusses information management, from documents, to email, to audio and video
    files, to data sets, and how information managers are building infrastructure
    to handle the tidal wave of digital files.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="report__section-title">Internal Access and Storytelling</span>
    explores how describing and applying metadata to records can help staff more
    easily find and use their archive to inform their work.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="report__section-title">Public Access and Storytelling</span>
    describes how foundations make their history accessible to the public, from
    exhibits, to published histories, to transitioning their archive to an external
    repository.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Along the way, readers will find anecdotes, tips, and resources that colleagues
  shared through presentations, as well as in conversations during and after the
  conference.

  The information assets that are created and received by staff at a foundation
  come in many shapes and sizes. Think paper-based text files, but also emails and
  their attachments, videos, images, audio recordings, social media posts, web sites, data
  sets, computer code, and formats of the future that have not been conceived of yet.
  The processes involved in managing records and archives have a sifting effect on
  the flow of assets in an organization. Not every email, report, or spreadsheet is a
  record, not every record is archival. With that said, here are a few definitions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="text--bold">Record:</span> <span class="text--italic">Information
    created, received, and maintained as evidence and as an asset by an organization
    or person, in pursuit of legal obligations or in the transaction of business.</span>
    <sup>1</sup>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="text--bold">Records management:</span>
    <span class="text--italic">Field of management responsible for the efficient
    and systematic control of the creation, receipt, maintenance, use, and disposition
    of records, including processes for capturing and maintaining evidence of and
    information about business activities and transactions in the form of records.
    </span><sup>2<sup>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="text--bold">Archival record:</span> <span class="text--italic">
    Materials created or received by a person, family, or organization, public or
    private, in the conduct of their affairs that are preserved because of the
    enduring value contained in the information they contain or as evidence of
    the functions and responsibilities of their creator.</span>
    <sup>3</sup>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Information governance and knowledge management are two other terms often associated
  with records management and archives. Information governance is a broader term
  that encompasses an organization's policies and systems that guide what information
  is managed, where, and for how long. Records management and archives programs
  are often a subset of an organization's information governance plan. Knowledge
  management was once limited to the management and use of information created by an
  organization, but more recently the concept of knowledge management has widened
  to include educational or informational resources from outside the organization
  such as databases, publications, and mined data. These two terms reach beyond the scope
  of discussions and presentations at the 2019 Advancing Foundation Archives meeting
  but are worthy of further exploration at future convenings.
