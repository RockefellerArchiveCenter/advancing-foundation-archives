<p class="report__lede">
  A vast amount of information – data, web content, images, videos, documents, email
  – flows through a foundation's systems. Some of this information is structured
  data in a content management systems, such as grants or financial data. Other
  types of data, such as files in shared drives and cloud storage, are unstructured.
  Some of this information is created by people employed by the foundation. Other
  information is created by people with relationships with the foundation, such
  as trustees or grantees. Still more information is created by people with no formal
  relationship to the foundation but is collected by foundation staff to help inform
  their work – books, journal articles, white papers, software code, data sets,
  images, audio recordings, and videos.
</p>

<p>
  The professionals who attended the Advancing Foundation Archives meeting all have
  a specific relationship with the kinds of information described above. Some are
  information managers, who sift and organize information so that current staff
  can learn from it. Some are records managers, who maintain control of the information
  created to support the work of the foundation. Others are grants managers, who
  focus on a specific subset of records typically stored as structured content in
  a grants management system. Then there are the archivists, who work with the records
  manager to preserve, describe, and provide access to information that documents
  the foundation history. Finally, there are the historians and other researchers,
  who study the records in public archives and interpret the information they contain
  in new ways.
</p>

<h2 id="records-management">Records Management</h2>

<p>
  For the foundation's information to be useful as archives to both present and
  future staff and to researchers, it must first be identified, categorized, and
  organized. This is the work of records managers. They have two main tools at their
  disposal: a records management policy and a retention schedule.
</p>

<p>
  Several presenters at the AFA meeting shared their experiences starting or revisiting
  a records management program. Lori Eaton initiated a records policy and retention
  schedule at the Ralph C. Wilson, Jr. Foundation:
</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    Developing a records-management policy and retention schedule was an important
    first step in determining which records belonged in the archives. Through the
    records-inventory process, we took the time to note who creates and collaborates
    on what kind of records, where the records are being saved, and whether they should
    be published to the website or preserved in perpetuity. Luckily, in many foundations
    there are natural dams in the landscape that are created during the ebb and flow
    of grantmaking. When a grant closes is a natural point to collect records for the
    archive. After a board meeting is another natural time on the calendar to push
    forward final documents to the archive.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  A records retention schedule identifies each type of record the foundation creates,
  from board minutes to personnel records to grant agreements, and defines how it
  is stored and managed over time. Federal and state regulations specify how long
  certain kinds of records must be kept and when they can be dispositioned (destroyed
  or archived). As Amy Gipson of the Gates Foundation said, legal counsel can be
  an important partner for a records management program:
</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    We just did a refresh this year, and I'm so happy to say that, after four years
    of working with our legal team, who owns our records-management program, we have
    refreshed the policy to include preservation of records. This has been a lot of
    work and a great partnership between the archive and our legal team. We also refreshed
    our [records retention] schedule to list out every type of record that should also
    be transferred to the archive with disposition and guidance in that as well.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Robin Krause reinforced the value of working with legal counsel when developing
  records policies and deciding on retention:
</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    As lawyers, so much of what we do with our clients is help them think about things
    like: What are the records you need to keep? What do you do when something happens
    with the records that you have? When should you and should you not be retaining
    versus destroying records? And then kind of falling into this landscape for the
    organizations we work with, which are large foundations, small foundations, public
    charities, all kinds of entities: How do you determine what is archival versus
    just a record? How do you help them think about what that process looks like?
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Hope Lyons of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund described how staff participate in
  the records management process:
</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    In terms of our approach to records management, as much as possible we make it
    so seamless that most people who are participants in the process don't know that
    they're doing it. They put this paper here, and then they upload the file there,
    and it's just integrated into their day-to-day work. And for us, that's become
    an absolutely essential part of the process.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Angela White of IUPUI had this advice for foundations when thinking about what
  records to keep:
</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    We like to joke that records managers always want to throw
    things away and archivists always want to keep everything. It's not true. Neither
    part of that is true, but I think it gets to the heart of the thing. There is a
    huge element of risk management and records management that I do have to think
    about as an archivist. Because of the way we get collections, we do have to play
    records manager a little more than we otherwise might because the institutions
    that we work with very rarely have records managers. It's amazing, every institution
    that I think I've ever worked with has piles and piles of bank statements and utility
    bills. You really don't need to keep those forever, I promise.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Stanley Katz, a Princeton historian attending the meeting said this about limiting
  what records move through the records management program and into the archives:
</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    We really don't know what the interesting historical questions are going to be,
    and I would urge you, as you think about particular rules for record retention a
    nd so forth. It's mainly the retention I'm concerned about. We can fight about
    access down the line. But if you don't have it, it's not going to be available
    for use. There are ways to protect the usage of material, we all know that, but
    I think a lot more energy needs to go into thinking about history as a stakeholder
    in this process, that there are organizations and individuals who spend their
    lives doing this.
  </p>
</div>

<p>Bob Clark of the Rockefeller Archive Center responded by saying:</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    The reality is that records management and archives require choices. And archivists, a
    nd records managers, and lawyers, and leaders in organizations try to make the
    best-informed choice possible to create the most robust record while also taking
    into consideration that these are not dead-letter archives. I used to work at the
    Roosevelt Presidential Library. That was a dead-letter archive. There were no more
    Roosevelt records being created by Franklin and Eleanor; they were gone. But in
    foundations, [records] are constantly being created, and so it's constantly tacking
    back and forth, and re-evaluating your risk, what your goals are year to year.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  As the participants quoted above indicated, the records that foundations manage
  today come in digital form; they are born digital. While a retention schedule can
  and should be format agnostic in terms of what records will be kept, for how long,
  and how they should be dispositioned, managing born-digital records requires thinking
  through new processes that take into consideration both the unique characteristics
  of born-digital records and the systems where they are created and stored.
</p>

<h2 id="digital-archives">Digital Archives</h2>

<p>
  Digital records can exist as multiple copies that are virtually identical. When
  a records retention schedule indicates that a copy of board minutes should be sent
  to the archives, it is simple enough to move a copy from the active board minutes
  folder in a shared drive or cloud storage folder to the digital archives folder
  within the same storage system. However, challenges arise when digital grant records
  must be exported from a content management system to save a copy for the archive.
  Many CMS applications don't provide a way to automate the export of specific data,
  and as a result, they require a more time-consuming manual approach. In addition,
  care must be taken to maintain the context between field data and uploaded files
  or links to files that point to storage locations in an external application.
  Another factor to keep in mind is that preserving digital records in a way that
  aspires to best practice standards requires more than simply copying files from
  an active folder to an archival folder. Digital preservation is covered at the
  end of this section, but three specific kinds of digital records inspired many
  conversations throughout the Advancing Foundation Archives meeting: email, grant
  records, and data sets.
</p>

<p>
  Email is the new correspondence. Correspondence has been a core record group in
  archival collections since archivists first began collecting. Traditionally, correspondence
  includes letters, cards, memoranda, and notes, whether they be formal or informal,
  typewritten or handwritten. In organizations today, email stands in for all those
  things and more: calendar invites, subscription newsletters, solicitations from
  vendors, organization-wide broadcast emails, updates from social media accounts,
  order information, personal non-work-related messages, and the list goes on. Only
  a fraction of that might be considered a record of the organization, so what does
  that mean when the email account of a long-serving staff member is made available
  to the archive? While email as a record may hold an element of risk as explored
  in the previous section, email as correspondence remains a critical record group
  for the digital archives.
</p>

<p>
  Marion Greenup, of the Simons Foundation, described a project management application
  where email-like messages are managed.
</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    We manage a lot of our programs using other platforms like Teamwork or Basecamp,
    and some of them quite extensively. We launched a program in 2006 to recruit families,
    who had only one child with a diagnosis of autism. We did extensive work, including
    the genetics, but the entire project, managed with thirteen sites in North America,
    was all managed on one platform. Most of the emails associated with any of the
    decision-making [for that project] were all done there.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  These "in-app" messages and their attachments contain critical documentary evidence
  that detail how the project was managed.
</p>

<p>
  For individual staff members, knowing their email will be accessible to them indefinitely
  may be comforting but what happens when a staff member leaves? Many IT departments
  close accounts and can assign access to that account to incoming staff or to a
  supervisor. This provides limited access to the email, but if the email account
  had been transferred to the archive, it could have become accessible to staff across
  the foundation and possibly, at a later date, to researchers. The historians at
  the meeting advocated for archiving email because they value the context it provides
  to the other records in the collection.
</p>

<p>
  One approach to archiving email is to ask staff to selectively save email messages
  that document a decision by exporting them from the email system and filing them
  with related records. At a minimum, many foundations ask program staff to upload
  grant-related email to the grants management system. Another approach, one used
  frequently by government agencies, is the capstone approach. This approach stipulates
  that the entire email account for staff in senior level positions be archived.
  In a foundation context, this might include the president/CEO and other executive
  level positions. The panelists and presenters did not delve into the processes
  and workflows that they use to archive emails. Different email management systems
  provide different mechanisms for exporting messages. There are also tools that
  let archivists redact email that may contain personal information or are associated
  with specific senders. (See the sidebar for resources on email archiving.)
</p>

<p>
  Grant records in archival collections are valued highly by researchers not only
  because they document the foundation's history of grant making, but also because
  they document the history of the hundreds or even thousands of nonprofits and individuals
  the foundation supported. In some cases, this may be the only historical footprint
  left by a particular organization or individual. In the past, those records were
  collected in paper grant files. Today, most foundations use a grants management
  system.
</p>

<p>
  Both Phoebe Kowalewski and Lori Eaton mentioned working with grant records exported
  from Fluxx in their presentation. While grants management systems like Fluxx,
  SmartSimple, and Salesforce are frequently the system of record for active grants,
  to capture closed grant records for archiving means that both the information entered
  in data fields and any uploaded files must be exported in a way that maintains
  their relationship to one another. Few proprietary grants management systems have
  considered the need for archiving closed grants and therefore have not built-in
  automated export options. Grants management system developers have little economic
  incentive to help subscribers export content and potentially move it to a different
  system. However, these vital records should not be trapped inside an application
  developed and controlled by an external organization.
</p>

<p>
  During the meeting, side conversations about archiving grant records from grants
  management systems sparked a working group of archivists who later shared ad hoc
  workflows to export closed grants from Fluxx and lobbied Fluxx developers for an
  automated solution. More conversations among grants managers, IT staff, and archivists
  will be needed to highlight the importance of exporting grant records so they can
  be archived. Preserving closed grant records in a stable, nonproprietary system,
  will ensure they are as accessible as paper grant records to both staff and researchers.
  This will be an important discussion topic for future foundation archives meetings
  since best practices both for archiving and data security for grant records are
  a critical need.
</p>

<p>
  Datasets are another type of record that foundations sometimes grapple with, particularly
  as many foundations require grantees to have a data management plan when a grant
  involves data collection. Like the National Science Foundation, private foundations
  expect grantees to deposit data sets in open access repositories. (See the sidebar
  for additional resources.) The topic of datasets sparked insights from several
  presenters:
</p>

<p>Marion Greenup, Simons Foundation:</p>
<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    At Simons, we have a real commitment to large datasets, it's our first love. And
    all of our grants come with terms and conditions that include data sharing and
    open access on some level. And for those datasets that we have declared a priority,
    we receive them, and we will host them, and we will create the right kind of access
    for them. We are learning as we go along, how to do this better, what kinds of
    issues there might be, but it's a big commitment to hosting, sharing, and protecting
    these very large datasets. And we talk about this all the time and worry about
    the risk associated with it.
  </p>
</div>

<p>Nicki Lodico, Ford Foundation:</p>
<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    We currently don't have a process for managing large datasets that are given to
    us by our grantees. This is something that I think we need to be talking with
    the [Rockefeller] Archive Center about as we're preparing to archive our digital
    files. What are the opportunities for managing large datasets? And I think it's
    a question for all of philanthropy as well. What are our obligations for doing
    this and what is the value and power of having a large source of datasets across
    all of our different organizations?
  </p>
</div>

<p>Bob Clark, Rockefeller Archive Center</p>
<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    [Datasets] present challenges that quite frankly are unsustainable from an archives
    perspective. Do we start to think outside the box and look for institutions that
    are doing that kind of work better and partner with them? Maybe a dataset from
    a foundation is hosted somewhere else, but because of the beauty of the twenty-first
    century, we can make connections to that location from the foundation record collections
    in our repository so that researchers can seamlessly be referred to that
    organization.
  </p>
</div>

<p>Angela White, IUPUI:</p>
<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    Being part of an academic institution here is a big benefit. We have a data librarian.
    She's not specifically for special collections, but she manages all the big datasets
    for grants that our researchers, particularly in public health, get. Making the
    datasets available is part of these agreements. We have ways of preserving this
    data and someone devoted to cleaning data and making it available in a useful format.
    So, you know, partnering with academic institutions that are research intensive
    is probably one way around this.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  As with digital grant records, data sets are another digital record that could
  be a topic taken up at a future foundation archives meeting.
</p>

<h2 id="preservation-of-digital-archival-records">Preservation of Digital Archival Records</h2>

<p>
  In paper-based archival collections, records are preserved in acid-free folders
  and boxes in a secure, climate-controlled facility. Care is taken to remediate
  records that may have been damaged by moisture, exposure to light, or pests. Many
  experts believe that digital archival records are even more fragile than paper
  records. At the very least, records made up of 0s and 1s require a different kind
  of preservation environment than do paper records. Best practices in digital preservation
  have been developed and refined, and foundation archivists are stepping into these
  waters as well. "We're living in a world where so much is digital, the ability
  to archive it digitally is absolutely paramount to make sure that that history
  is accessible," Lyons said. "The push that the Rockefeller Archive Center has made
  around electronic archiving is a really key component of that."
</p>

<p>
  The Rockefeller Archive Center has developed an open-source digital records transfer
  system called Aurora that allows it to receive copies of digital records directly
  from foundation donors and then move the records and metadata about them into its
  existing digital preservation and content management infrastructure, where the
  records can be preserved securely according to industry best practices and then
  described and made accessible for research.
</p>

<p>
  There are cloud-based preservation applications available to foundations that
  want to manage digital preservation internally. Archivematica is a preservation
  management system developed as an open-source, community-supported application
  and is used by the Rockefeller Archive Center and by many college and university
  libraries with the technical staff to set up and support it.
</p>

<p>
  Lori Eaton deployed a subscription-based solution to manage the Ralph C. Wilson,
  Jr. Foundation's archive:
</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    In April 2019, we selected Preservica, a digital-preservation environment, to
    preserve our important digital records. The records can be stored in Preservica
    through spenddown, and Preservica can be set up to disposition accounts payable
    and other nonarchival records that we might be required to keep for a few years
    after spenddown. Most importantly, it can migrate file formats and prevent data
    loss for the files ingested to it today, through 2035, and beyond.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  A foundation's IT department can be a key ally in the file storage and digital
  systems landscape. As participants in one of the Liberating Structures Lunch scenarios
  suggested, establish a collaborative relationship with IT staff and/or consultants,
  educate them about archival records, and gain their assistance in planning for
  preservation. Before having a conversation with IT, consider getting educated
  about what digital preservation means in an archive setting. Colleen McDonough,
  archivist for the Kettering Foundation, turned to professional organizations for
  boosting her knowledge:
</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    We are looking into digital preservation, since we have an influx of that [born-digital
    archival records] coming our way, and we'll be facing more and more of that in
    the future. An important aspect has been training with digital archives, which
    means my assistant archivist and I have both taken DAS [Digital Archives Specialist]
    classes through SAA [Society of American Archivists].
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Courses like those offered by the Society of American Archivists and other organizations
  dedicated to digital preservation as well as books like Trevor Owens'
  <span class="text--italic">The Theory and Craft of Digital Preservation</span>
  can help foundation archivists be better prepared to advocate for the tools they
  need to preserve born-digital foundation records in the archives. (See the sidebar
  for a list of digital preservation organizations.)</p>

<p>
  One thing that records managers and archivists can be sure of is that the systems
  and technologies used to create, manage, store, retrieve, and archive foundation
  records will change. For proof of that, consider the thumb drives and external
  storage disks gathering dust in office closets and desk drawers. As new technologies
  emerge, it will be important for information management professionals to communicate
  with one another both inside and outside the foundation to ensure that applications
  and solutions meet a variety of needs.
