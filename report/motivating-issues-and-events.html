<p class="report__lede">
  Ask any archivist at the Advancing Foundation Archives meeting how their foundation's
  archive got started and you might hear a different germination story. Some might
  say it was a move to a new location that prompted a deeper look at what was in
  each closet and filing cabinet. Others might have begun as a rescue mission –
  boxes of old program officer diaries found gathering mold in a basement storage
  room. For still others it was an anniversary, retirement, or major milestone approaching.
  On the darker side, perhaps a looming litigation or a security breach. All these
  germination points have one thing in common, a ticking clock, something that brings
  urgency to the project.
</p>

<p>
  While the motivation that a deadline or inciting incident brings can turn an idea
  into a thriving archive, starting an archiving program without an urgent deadline
  is certainly possible with the right combination of leadership interest and staff.
  Conversations about data security can point organizations toward an archiving process.
  A focus on accountability and transparency can also spark the growth of an archive.
</p>

<h2 id="anniversaries-retirements-and-other-milestone-events">Anniversaries, retirements, and other milestone events</h2>

<p>
  An immoveable date on the calendar is one of the most common galvanizing events
  for a foundation archive. The date could be a major anniversary, the retirement
  of a beloved long-time staff or board member, or even a date with a moving company.
  While not every foundation contemplates a move, every foundation will face anniversaries
  on the horizon as well as staff and trustee departures.
</p>

<div class="report__sidebar">
  <p class="text--bold">
    Anniversaries are such a common impetus for starting an archive that it was one
    of the case studies discussed at each table during the "15% Solutions for Foundation
    Archives Advancement" lunch session.
  </p>

  <p>Here was the scenario:</p>

  <p class="text--italic">
    The archives program at your foundation is new, and next year is the foundation's
    50th anniversary. The communications department wants to incorporate stories from
    your foundation's history into promotional blog posts and materials. Currently,
    the archives simply contain boxes upon boxes of old records that have not yet been
    inventoried. How do you quickly apply order to this disorganization, so that you
    can make use of the history it contains?
  </p>

  <p>
    Examples for some of the solutions the various table groups came up with included
    the following:
  </p>

  <p class="text--bold">Table 1</p>
  <p>
    We decided to focus on quick wins – photos, high-value items, stories, perhaps
    even stories that everybody already knows. Start getting those out there to gain
    staff buy-in. And we also suggested that we get some oral historians on board
    to conduct interviews and capture even more stories.
  </p>

  <p class="text--bold">Table 2</p>
  <p>
    We called the Rockefeller Archive Center, they sent us a crackerjack archivist
    to come in and consult with us. The archivist helped us sort out our thoughts and
    put our ideas on paper. With her help we, we were able to create a proposal
    to the <a href="https://www.leonlevyfoundation.org/">Leon Levy Foundation</a>,
    which is known for funding this kind of work in the nonprofit sphere.
  </p>

  <p class="text--bold">Table 3</p>
  <p>We decided to leverage existing knowledge to come up with a story that will satisfy
    the immediate need of the anniversary. Once that proves the value of the archive,
    the archives and records management functions should receive more funding.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Anniversaries planted the idea to start an archive for two of the presenters in
  the Getting It Done: Collaborative Case Studies Session as well. As Michael Walter
  from International House explained:
</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    Despite accumulating almost one hundred years' worth of documents, International
    House has never had a formal archive program. In 2018, we began to rectify this.
    We engaged the Winthrop Group to help us get a better understanding of our options
    and potential long-term management and access to records. There were multiple
    drivers for this partnership. First, our endangered historical records had reached
    a state of criticality. Quite simply, the House's records were and are falling apart.
    Second, International House celebrates its centennial in 2024. There's a familiar
    theme going on here. Without access to our archives, there's no way we could celebrate
    this centennial properly. We would lose opportunities for reflection, context,
    and innovation, some of the most exciting aspects of a centennial.
  </p>
</div>

<p>Other foundation archives that began because of an anniversary on the horizon included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="text--bold">Hogg Foundation for Mental Health</span> – Session
    presenter Elizabeth Stauber was hired as the Hogg Foundation's first archivist
    in 2015 as the foundation celebrated 75 years.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="text--bold">Simons Foundation</span> – Panelist Marion Greenup
    noted that as the foundation approached its 25th anniversary: "It seemed to
    me we had the opportunity to prospectively plan for how we were going to retain
    records and documents that were important to our science. Our foundation has
    a low-key approach to the foundation itself but not to its work, so the aim was
    not so much to tell the story of the foundation but to tell the story of the
    researchers we fund." With the foundation president as a champion, the Simons
    Foundation began to talk with senior program staff about what would be valuable
    to include and eventually launched a pilot project focused on archiving a major
    initiative.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Sometimes an anniversary can add a new element to an already established archives.
  Several presenters and panelists reported that oral history programs were developed
  or reinvigorated by anniversaries. Oral histories are a way to capture foundation
  stories that aren't easily recorded in documents that represent the day-to-day
  grantmaking work of the foundation.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="text--bold">Mastercard Foundation</span> – Justin Greenland Duke
    of the Mastercard Foundation and Eric Abrahamson of Vantage Point History developed
    an oral history project in response to the foundation's 10th anniversary.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="text--bold">Rockefeller Brothers Fund – Hope Lyons said that the
    archives had begun doing oral histories around the 75th anniversary in 2015,
    with a focus on long-time board members and staff.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Oral history interviews with a CEO who is departing or trustee who is rotating
  off the board can document the "view from the top" perspective. Interviewing staff
  at any level of the organization who have witnessed tremendous change can be equally
  valuable. For example, Vicente Velasco, a Ford Foundation employee who had served
  in a variety of roles – including as a waiter in the private dining room – during
  his fifty years of service was set to retire. "We're doing an oral history of
  Vicente because he knows more truths that are more juicy, more interesting, than
  almost anyone else in the foundation, and wouldn't it be a shame to lose that,"
  Hilary Pennington said. (See the sidebar for additional oral history resources.)
</p>

<p>
  As Michael Walter mentioned earlier, there are often multiple reasons that point
  toward the need for an archive. In the case of International House, physical records
  were at risk, however, it is important to keep in mind that digital records are
  even more fragile than paper documents.
</p>

<h2 id="records-at-risk">Records at risk</h2>

<p>
  Records at risk of damage, destruction, and loss took center stage at different
  times during the meeting and surfaced different points of view. "Risk" as a word
  had different meaning for different archives stakeholders. To some, loss of the
  historical record was the primary risk. This definition of loss was voiced most
  often by historians and professionals at the archival institutions charged with
  preserving the narrative of philanthropic organizations. To others, public access
  to sensitive records was the primary risk. Records managers and information managers
  inside foundations presented this as a concern that often came from the very top
  of the organization.
</p>

<p>
  It is easy to find examples of risk to digital records. One needs to look no further
  than ransomware attacks, hacked email accounts, and database breaches. Senior
  leadership or staff may turn to records managers and archivists for help when urgent
  concerns about security of digital records arise. This sudden scrutiny puts records
  management and records retention policies in the spotlight. This can be a good thing
  for archives. Records management is covered in greater detail in Section 4, but
  for now the key point is that records managers and archivists can turn conversations
  about digital risk into discussions about organization-wide policies that improve
  both data security and identification of archival records.
</p>

<p>
  One of the questions Bob Clark, director of archives at the Rockefeller Archive
  Center, asked panel participants was how their perception of risk was impacted by
  whether the records were paper or digital. Immediately the stories turned to the
  risks in digital records and specifically in email. Robin Krause, the attorney
  with Patterson Belknap Webb &amp; Tyler recounted a case that involved legal review
  of email:
</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    I was recently working with an organization that gives a lot of grants to very
    active, political-leaning organizations, and one of their grantees is being investigated
    by a government agency. The foundation is not a target of the investigation but
    they're a grantor and they received an FBI subpoena for their grant files. We got
    their paper grant files, and they were what you would expect to see in a paper grant
    file. They had the original proposals and correspondence, the grant agreements,
    and then some reporting. And then we had to obtain their electronic email records
    for the grant. There were lots of emails that, because they were electronic, no
    one had printed them and put them in the grant file. I don't think they thought of
    them as part of the grant file, but they were producible under the subpoena. In
    the emails there were lots of conversations between the program officer and the
    grantee who is the target of this investigation.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Email was one of the most-discussed individual record types at the meeting and for
  good reason. Every staff member has a foundation email account, and each person
  may send and receive hundreds of emails a week. Some of that email may contain
  decisions, actions, and debates that document the foundation's work, yet mixed
  in with those archive-worthy messages are spam emails, mailing lists, daily news,
  and other transient information.
</p>

<p>
  One meeting attendee said her organization's policy was to maintain all email forever,
  yet it was also policy not to archive email in bulk but rather to ask employees to
  save those they thought had value to a folder outside the email system. This
  presents a risk not only that the organization's email going back years could be
  hacked but also means only a small portion of those emails will be preserved in
  an archive.
</p>

<p>
  In response to Bob Clark's digital risk question, Hilary Pennington of the Ford
  Foundation said that for many program officers, their email was their filing system.
  They kept a lot of their grant files in folders in their email account. Then two
  years ago, after a lot of discussion, Ford decided to move to a one-year retention –
  meaning email is deleted from the email application (Outlook, Gmail, etc.) one
  year after it was sent or received.
</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    Each program officer had to think about what they're keeping in their email for
    the record and for the archives, enough to make sure they save it somewhere, because
    if they don't save it somewhere each year our system just empties out and deletes
    their email files. And that can be pretty freaky when you go to click that little
    folder where you saved everything about X and it's empty. It's a very challenging
    conversation, and we have done funny, witty, trainings for staff to try to help them
    understand this and to care about it and to pay attention. But it's an ongoing
    evergreen thing, and I don't think any of us probably have it exactly right.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Speaking for maintaining the historical record, Angela White, philanthropic studies
  archivist at Indiana University Purdue University at Indianapolis, advocated for
  keeping email as an important record category with value for future historians.
</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
  It's scary for foundations and for other nonprofits to turn over their email for
    all of the reasons that we've heard, but without it the context is gone, and you
    can't really understand why decisions were made. Email is the most likely way that
    those discussions take place. It's really painful to me when I talk to an organization
    and explain the ways we can mitigate risk using redaction tools and still they say,
    'we'll think about the email.' Please don't withhold the email. This is what
    historians want.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  The email conversation is an opportunity to talk to stakeholders about building
  an archiving program that takes sensitivities to risk into consideration while
  at the same time preserving the historical context about the foundation's work.
</p>

<p>Digital records aren't the only records at risk in a foundation. As the transition
  to digital systems evolved, physical records have been relegated to boxes in closets,
  filing cabinets, offsite storage facilities, and even basements. Michael
  Walter and Sam Markham shared photos of the boxes they found in the basement of
  International House as they began the hunt for historical records. "They were disorganized,
  inaccessible, vulnerable to loss, and the vulnerability was actually
  something that was not hypothetical, it was real," Markham said. "There had been
  a flood right before the Winthrop project started that damaged a small group of records."
</p>

<p>
  Anecdotal stories of records in basements popped up in the "Liberating Structures
  Lunch Session: 15% Solutions for Foundation Archives Advancement" as well. When
  Elizabeth Stauber was hired to start the Hogg Foundation Archives, she found "records
  hidden in the backs of filing cabinets, basements, closets, mysterious black holes
  that continue to pop up today." While not all these records may be at risk of
  physical destruction as the International House records were, they are useless to
  current and future foundation staff and to historians if they remain buried. Shining
  sunlight on those records can help mitigate the risk of damage and loss and give
  the foundation an opportunity to be more fully accountable for and engaged with
  its past.
</p>

<h2 id="accountability-and-transparency">Accountability and transparency</h2>

<p>
  If foundation stakeholders manage risk by deliberating carefully about which records
  should be included in an archive, then taking the next step - to be accountable
  and transparent to internal and external stakeholders - will be less fraught. In
  his opening remarks, Darren Walker noted that "during a time of growing inequality
  and a time of growing cynicism about wealth and about even philanthropy, there
  is greater demand on us to be transparent in ways that we haven't had to be in the
  past."
</p>

<p>
  Greater accountability and transparency can mean educating foundation staff about
  past work to improve the work they are doing today. This has been a focus of Stauber's
  work at the Hogg Foundation:
</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    In order to do this [grantmaking] work honestly, we had to become a self-reflective
    organization that is transparent not only to the public but also to ourselves.
    What were we like as an organization fifty, sixty, and now coming up on eighty years
    ago? How have we evolved or changed, or have we changed at all? How do the projects,
    controversies, and successes from our history subtly influence the way that we
    operate today? It was time to understand and contextualize our history in order to
    make us better partners to our grantees and fellow Texas funders.
  </p>

  <p>
    To promote the use of the newly established Hogg Foundation Archives and begin
    the work towards becoming a self-reflective organization, I began leading quarterly
    history lessons to our staff in 2017. My first lesson was on a program in the 1970s
    to bring mental health services to Zavala County at the same time as the rise of
    La Raza Unida, a Chicano nationalist organization that had prominence throughout
    Texas, California, and a few other southwestern states. Zavala County is located in
    south Texas, at the heart of a multi-million-dollar agri-business center where
    farmers grow crops such as spinach year-round. The agricultural economy brought
    in many laborers from Mexico, and over the decades this led to a majority population of
    Mexican American laborers and a minority population of White landowners. The main
    goal of La Raza Unida was to improve the economic, social, and political prospects
    of the majority Mexican American community that had historically been denied to
    them because of systemic reasons. Leaders in the party began applying for grants
    and attempting to bring jobs and social services to the neglected area. While La
    Raza Unida had political power in Zavala County, it was tenuous because they still did
    not have much economic power or broad influence throughout the state. The Zavala
    County Mental Health Outreach Program was largely considered a failure. The services
    we provided through it did not last long after the funding period ended. We were
    operating as outsiders, attempting to bring support to a community at war with each
    other. The program required community organizing, building trust, systemic change,
    and a long-term investment, none of which we were equipped to handle at the time.
    However, the challenges that arose during the program are challenges that we still
    face today as an organization and as a state: cultural competencies, addressing
    determinants of mental health – such as systemic racism and poverty – and community
    building. We must use our past failures and successes to inform our approaches to
    these continuing challenges, or we will fall into the same traps as we did before.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Hope Lyons of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund echoed Stauber's experience with making
  sure staff had access to the records they needed for the core business activity
  of grantmaking. "At the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, there is a deep family
  commitment to both recordkeeping and philanthropy, and transparency about those
  activities and the records are a key part of that."
</p>

<p>
  Beyond meeting the needs of internal stakeholders, establishing an archive, and
  providing a way for the public to access those records can demonstrate a foundation's
  willingness to be accountable for how it invests funds in social programs and
  communities. Foundations benefit from a tax protected status, which means some
  of those grantmaking dollars that would ordinarily be part of federal and state
  revenues are instead controlled by a private foundation. Foundations are required
  to file tax returns that disclose grantee organizations and dollar amounts on an
  annual basis but, unlike the finance, insurance, or health care industries, foundations
  are not required to provide additional reporting about how effective those grants were
  in improving the lives of people in the communities they aim to serve. As Darren
  Walker, Ford Foundation President, said in his remarks:
</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    We remain the only sector in our society that does not have an external check on
    us. Yes, we have the IRS, and yes, we have regulations and our general counsel
    keeps us out of trouble, but I worked at a bank, I worked at a nonprofit. Every day
    there was an external pressure on me and the organizations I worked for to deliver
    for customers, clients, people living in Harlem who we were there to serve. Every
    day I felt that pressure. If we're to be honest with ourselves about philanthropy,
    we don't feel that pressure. We feel a different pressure. A passion to do justice
    in the world and to make a difference, and to cure and solve some of these seemingly
    intractable problems. But it really takes a lot of self-generated determination
    to be transparent, to monitor one's institutions, and to really take impact seriously.
    We can't take impact seriously if we don't take the preservation of our history
    seriously and if we're not willing to invest in it.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Placing archival records in the hands of the public sends a clear signal that the
  foundation takes accountability and transparency seriously. It is a judgement day
  of sorts for any organization that opens its records to the public and asks: Did we
  make the best grants we could? Could we have done better? Did we have the impact
  we hoped we would? Luckily, there are consultants and archival repositories with
  knowledgeable staff who can help guide foundations as they build their archives and
  take the first steps toward opening them to the public.
</p>

<h2 id="where-to-turn-for-help">Where to turn for help</h2>

<p>Many people at the meeting who were charged with developing an archive or a records management program emphasized their reliance on outside experts. Every foundation will need to develop its own mix of internal and external support for archives
  and records, but it may be useful to consider a few of the models represented by the presenters and panelists.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="text--bold">Internal records management staff and internal archives
    staff:</span> At the Gates Foundation most staff supporting the records management
    (Gates Foundation) and archives (Gates Archives) are employed directly by one
    of these two organizations.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="text--bold">Internal records management staff and external archives
    support:</span> the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund both have
    internal staff who support records management and archiving across their organization
    but work with the Rockefeller Archive Center to preserve their archives and provide
    access to records that will be made public.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="text--bold">External records management and external archives support:</span>
    Like many small foundations that are reluctant to add staff, the Ralph C. Wilson
    Jr. Foundation contracted with an archives consultant to establish a records
    management and archives program. After the foundation spends down, it expects
    to donate its records to an external repository to facilitate public access.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Archival repositories such as the Rockefeller Archive Center and the Philanthropy
  Archives of the Ruth Lilly Special Collections &amp; Archives at IUPUI are excellent
  places to turn to for expert advice on how to proceed with an archiving or
  records management project. An external archival repository collects the records
  of other organizations, preserves them, and makes them available to researchers.
  (See Section 6 for more on working with external repositories.) Archivists at these
  repositories are generous in sharing their expertise with organizations even if
  there is no formal donor relationship, as Stephanie Hislop, project manager at
  Margaret A. Cargill Philanthropies, found:
</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    The team at Rockefeller Archive Center has really helped to inspire us on our
    journey, in addition to giving us advice. Sometimes I just call them in when we
    need kind of a pep talk to get re-energized. This began in 2016 when the head of
    RAC came and spoke with our leadership to help them flesh out their goals and their
    vision for archives at MACP. And that went so well that at the end of that year,
    we asked the RAC team to come back and do a day-long session with our staff, where
    we invited representatives from different functional areas all across the building
    to come in and talk about archives.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  Many small to mid-size foundations seek out records management or archives consultants
  who work with existing staff to establish or refresh their programs. Professional
  associations can be a great resource for finding a consultant.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="text--bold">Society of American Archivists:</span>
    <a href="https://www2.archivists.org/consultants">Directory of Archival Consultants</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="text--bold">Association of Records Managers &amp; Administrators (now ARMA International):</span>
    <a href="https://armabuyersguide.org/">ARMA Buyer's Guide</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Another source of information and inspiration is networking with other archivists.
  Nicki Garces, archivist and records manager with the Consuelo Foundation, found
  mentors to be instrumental in building knowledge:
</p>

<div class="report__quote">
  <p>
    The Association of Hawaii Archivists and the Society of American Archivists have
    been very supportive. I've been taking professional development courses and talking
    with people to find out best practices. I would also give a shout out to Jaimie
    Quaglino of the Gates Archives. She's been my mentor for over two years.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  In addition to the foundations noted in this report, many other foundations have
  archivists on staff and have well-developed archival programs. A little sleuthing
  can turn up one similar to yours in size or grantmaking focus with staff who may
  offer support. Foundation archivists and records managers are a small community,
  and everyone is eager to offer resources, share their own experience, or form a
  working group to solve a common problem.
</p>

<p>
  In the forward of this report, Lori Eaton mentioned the hard-to-find
  <span class="text--italic">Establishing a Foundation Archives</span> (1991)
  publication as a place she turned for support. This publication is now available
  in digital form on IssueLab (<a href="https://www.issuelab.org/">https://www.issuelab.org/</a>),
  a non-paywalled hosting site for research products published by social sector organizations
  around the world. Other places to look for published research include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="text--bold">The Foundation Review</span>
    (<a href="https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/tfr/">https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/tfr/</a>):
    Peer-reviewed journal of philanthropy, written by and for foundation staff and
    boards, and those who work implementing programs.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="text--bold">Center for Effective Philanthropy</span>
    (<a href="https://cep.org/">https://cep.org/</a>): Provides data, feedback, programs,
    and insights to help individual and institutional donors improve their
    effectiveness.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Whatever instigating event or issue arises for your foundation, seize the day.
  Start with a call to a local repository or a friendly foundation that already has
  a robust program established to collect archival materials. Gather advocates
  internally and begin crafting the case for building an archiving program. Once
  you have the buy-in you need, the next section provides guidance on how to approach
  records management and archives as integral parts of information management.
